shameless self-promotion
------------------------

### open source

*   Optimisations to Ridge Regression GCV code. [Here's the pull request](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/650). This is a contribution to the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning library for python.

### stuff I've coded for my own amusement

1.  [weighted_median](https://github.com/fcostin/weighted_median) - a library to
    compute the weighted median, in C++.
2.  [abfc](https://github.com/fcostin/abfc) - a self hosting compiler for the esoteric
    [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language, targeting GNU
    assembly backends for `ia32` and `x86_64`. Actually there are two compilers in this
    project - the second compiler is for a python DSL macro-language that targets
    brainfuck. This latter compiler, implemented in python, is used to generate the
    source of the former self-hosting brainfuck compiler. This sure beats writing
    the self-hosting brainfuck compiler in brainfuck by hand.
3.  [abfc_hs](https://github.com/fcostin/abfc_hs) - a haskell port of the python DSL
    macro-language to brainfuck compiler. Includes a parser for the macro-language
    implemented using the lovely [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec)
    combinator library.


### other stuff

*   i've entered the odd machine learning competition at [kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com).
